This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Barnehage is not just another project; it's a testament to the journey of learning Next.js. As a Frontend developer eager to delve into the world of server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), I embarked on this journey to grasp the nuances of Next.js. With a focus on UX and UI design, Barnehage became my canvas to experiment, learn, and overcome challenges.

Project Overview:- Barnehage is a web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a platform to explore the functionalities of Next.js while implementing modern design principles. The application showcases various components and features, seamlessly integrating user interaction with dynamic content.

Learning Next.js:- My journey with Next.js began with diving into its documentation and absorbing tutorials on platforms like YouTube. Armed with a basic understanding, I ventured into coding, creating components and leveraging Next.js's routing capabilities. The transition from React to Next.js was smooth yet enlightening, as I grasped the underlying concepts of server-side rendering and its implications on performance and SEO

Deployment Hurdles:- Deploying Barnehage on Vercel was an insightful experience. While Vercel's seamless deployment process impressed me, I encountered challenges in configuring environment variables and optimizing build settings. Overcoming these hurdles not only enhanced my deployment skills but also provided invaluable insights into the deployment ecosystem.

Conclusion:- Barnehage isn't just a project; it's a symbol of persistence, curiosity, and the never-ending quest for learning. Through lots of trial and error, fixing problems, and celebrating successes, I've not only gotten better at Next.js but also gained a greater love for web development. Adding Barnehage to my portfolio is just the beginning. I'm excited to keep learning and facing new challenges head-on.
